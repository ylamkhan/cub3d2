# 🕹️ cub3d

A simple 3D game inspired by *Wolfenstein 3D*, created as part of the **42 School curriculum**.  
This project is about **raycasting**: turning a 2D map into a 3D first-person perspective view.

## 📖 Project Overview

- Implement a **raycasting engine** to render a 3D environment from a 2D map.  
- Parse a `.cub` configuration file describing textures, colors, and the map.  
- Move around the maze with keyboard controls.  
- Handle collisions with walls.  
- Display textures on walls with perspective.
